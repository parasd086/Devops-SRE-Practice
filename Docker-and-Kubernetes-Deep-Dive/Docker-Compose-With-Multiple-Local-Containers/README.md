# Docker Compose Project With Multiple Containers

This project demonstrates the use of Docker Compose to create and manage two containers: one for an ExpressJs server and another for a Redis database. The ExpressJs server is a simple web application that displays the number of times the server has been visited. üöÄ

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Project Structure

- **index.js**: ExpressJs server code.
- **package.json**: Node.js project configuration.
- **Dockerfile**: Dockerfile for building the ExpressJs server container.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose configuration file.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository and Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parasd086/Devops-SRE-Practice.git
   cd Devops-SRE-Practice/
   cd Docker-and-Kubernetes-Deep-Dive/
   cd Docker-Compose-With-Multiple-Local-Containers
   ```

2. Build and start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the ExpressJs server container using the Dockerfile and start both the ExpressJs server and Redis containers.

3. Access the application:

   Open your browser and visit http://localhost:4001. You should see the number of visits displayed.

4. To stop the containers, use:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Configuration

- **ExpressJs Server Configuration:**
  The ExpressJs server is configured in `index.js`. You can modify the server logic and settings in this file.

- **Docker Compose Configuration:**
  Docker Compose settings are defined in `docker-compose.yml`. You can adjust container names, ports, and other configurations as needed.

## Dependencies

- **Express:**
  Web application framework for Node.js.

- **Redis:**
  In-memory data structure store used for storing visit counts.

## Notes

- The Redis server container is named `redis-server` and is accessible from the ExpressJs server using this hostname.
